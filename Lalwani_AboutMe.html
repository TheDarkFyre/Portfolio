            Hello. My name is Ansh Lalwani, and I am currently a junior at Dublin High School. I am currently taking AP Computer Science Applications this year, as my interests lay with programming. I havee taken one class each year of high school that has furthered my knowledge in computer science / programming. Working in the computer science field is something that I would like to do in the future, which is why I have taken these classes.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been working for a couple of years to improve my programming skills and to get close to achieving my dream. I have extremely good time management, as I am able to finish many assignments ahead of time, which gives me more time to focus on my hobbies outside of school. I am able to learn quickly and retain knowledge that might help me in the future. For example, I have been taking guitar lessons for around 7 years now, and I have persevered and worked hard to learn more and improve myself. I have made sure to get Honor Roll for all of middle school, ninth grade, and the first semester of 10th grade and I am aiming to continue that in the rest of high school as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            My skills are focused in computer science, as I am proficient in Python, Html and, CSS and I am constantly learning more languages to improve my skills in programming. Currently, I am learning Java. I have participated in the Dublin High School Chess Club as to interact with other people and to improve my adeptness in the game. Thank you for reading through my bio and I hope that you will take the time to look through the rest of my portfolio.
