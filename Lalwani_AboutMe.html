            Hello. My name is Ansh Lalwani, and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. I am curently taking an engineering class this year, buy my interests are in pursuing a career in the field of computer science. I plan to take at least one class each year that will further my knowledge in computer science or engineering. Working in the software field has been a dream of mine for a long time as technology will be our future, and I plan on being a part of the road to the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been working for a couple of years to improve my programming skills and to get close to achieving my dream. I have extremely good time management, as I am able to finish many assignments ahead of time, which gives me more time to focus on my hobbies outside of school. I am able to learn quickly and retain knowledge that might help me in the future. I am taking guitar lessons for around 6 years now, and I have persevered and worked hard to learn more and improve myself. I have made sure to get Honor Roll for all of middle school and ninth grade and I am aiming to continue that in high school as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            My skills are focused in computer science, as I am proficient in Python, Html and, CSS and I am constantly learning more languages to improve my skills in programming. I participate in the Dublin High School Chess Club as to interact with other people and to improve my adeptness in the game. Thank you for reading through my bio and I hope that you will take the time to look through the rest of my portfolio.
