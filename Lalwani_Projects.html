          <p>A project in which we coded a woorking escape room using Java on the website repl.it. We used some preexisting code as well as some that we coded ourselves to create walls, coins, and hidden traps. The project took a total of 3 days in class as well as 2 days at home for both the coding and the presentation.</p>

          <p>A engineering project in which we designed and built a bridge using Bridge Designer 2016. Each group member built a seperate bridge, and the bridge with the cheapest cost was chosen for the group. That bridge was then further edited to reduce the cost as much as possible, until no further edits could be made.</p>

          <p>
            A engineering project in which we each made a third of a Rube Goldberg machine that completes a simple task. We chose to make the final machine stamp papers. My section of the machine was the middle three machines, and contained a pulley, inclined plane, and first class lever. The final ideal mechanical advantage of my portion was five.

            A python project in which we took an image and changed it to the criteria that we chose based on the organisation we made it for. We chose the World Wildlife Fund, and decided to take some images of landscape and add a tint, title, logo, and mask.
